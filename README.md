## Purpose

Sports can be quite complex.  While many sports have an extremely simple goal, the actual mechanics and characteristics of sports can be incredibly arduous to comprehend.  In particular, American football is a sport comprised of a myriad of different plays and actions that can impact the objective of gaining yardage to accomplish the ultimate goal of scoring (ideally a touchdown).  Of course, the offense wants to score by run (rush) or throw (pass) plays with a ball to gain yards, moving towards the opposing teams' side of the field to score.  The defense wants to prevent the offensive teams' objective of scoring.

In the National Football League (NFL), about a third of teams' offensive yardage comes from run plays.  These run plays are thought to be attributed primarily to the talent of the ball carrier; however, the ball carrier's teammates, coach, and opposing defense have an enormous impact in the success of the ball carrier.  

Ultimately, this project explores game, play, and player-level data provided by NFL's Next Gen Stats.  Various neural network architectures and model types are experimented with and explored, and ultimately, deeper insights can help any lover of football to understand the various skills and strategies of players and coaches.

## FAQ

- How did you guys do on the Kaggle leaderboard?

> We actually didn't submit our model to Kaggle, for in order to compete in the Kaggle competition, it is necessary to use their builtin kaggle module.  For the purposes of this project, we instead chose to tweak the challenge to our own needs.

- How large was your dataset?

> It was X gigs.

- What inspired you to choose this project topic?

> In the evergrowing field of AI, ML and DL, algorithms are getting more and more complex.  Often, it is difficult to comprehend what the changes are in the field and what impact is ultimately made.  Especially for individuals that are less technology versed, it can be truly difficult to comprehend the meaningful effect of these fantastic technologies.  Thus, our group decided to choose a project topic that is meaningful and relatable to anyone: sports.  The NFL Big Data Bowl challenge gave us a headstart on the actual framework for our project, but ultimately, we just want to show that these remarkable emerging technologies are relatable to everyone, regardless of their background.
